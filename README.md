LIGHTNING SURGE DETECTOR 

The Lightning Surge Detector is an innovative device designed to detect and measure lightning surges, providing critical information for protecting electrical systems and infrastructure. Lightning strikes can cause significant damage to power grids, communication systems, and other electrical equipment, resulting in costly repairs and downtime. The Lightning Surge Detector aims to mitigate these risks by providing real-time detection and alert systems, enabling swift action to be taken to prevent or minimize damage.

This project leverages advanced sensor technology and sophisticated algorithms to accurately detect lightning surges and provide valuable insights into lightning activity. By developing a reliable and efficient detection system, this project seeks to contribute to the protection of electrical infrastructure and the prevention of lightning-related damage. The Lightning Surge Detector has the potential to be a valuable tool for utilities, communication companies, and other organizations that rely on electrical systems, helping to ensure the reliability and resilience of critical infrastructure.

Through this project, we aim to explore the design and development of a robust and user-friendly lightning surge detection system, capable of providing accurate and timely warnings of lightning activity. By harnessing the power of technology, we can better understand and mitigate the risks associated with lightning strikes, ultimately contributing to the safety and reliability of electrical systems.
